# pythonlearningnreferring
second iteration of the python ghome

This is a personal python "cheatsheet" for myself as I am still in the learning stages. I left the details in public mode to allow any and everyone to learn.
All of the code listed are from public sources and I hope that we can all have an enjoyable and easy time learning about Python.
